* What are we trying to build?

We want a lightweight, ephemeral storage API

- Create blob
- Retrieve blob
- Delete blob
- All blobs can hang around for a day, somewhat flexible on expiration
- ...and we want it... in the CLOUD!

* We choose the AWS stack, for reasons

- APIGW + Lambda to serve the code
- Lambda has had Go support since the start of 2018
- S3 will be our storage backend
- Lifecycle policies can handle the expiration for us

* Time to POC!

Native Go Lambda support with API Gateway isn't quite like using the standard `net/http` library. We have to satisfy the Handler interface, which always returns an error, and may optionally accept a `context.Context`, and may have an additional input and output type  as long as they are compatible with `encoding/json`

In our case, that looks like

 Handler(*events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) (*events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error)

Notably, there are a few definitions which will technically satisfy the Handler, nor is it a traditional Go interface we're implementing. Our handler can just as easily be unexported.

* POC Handler Code

Using the `events.APIGatewayProxyRequest` type directly: 
.code first/main.go /SWITCH OMIT/,/ENDSWITCH OMIT/

* POC POST Code

Some decoupling:

.code first/main.go /func post/,/}

Sub-functions don't know about APIGW-specific types

* POC tests

Using a normal testing approach, we can unit test some helpers

.code first/main_test.go /TEST OMIT/,

This makes us use dummy input, and doesn't give us great coverage

* Fully testing the POC 

Initial deploy

  terraform apply phase1.plan

  33.54s

Subsequent plan and apply

  terraform plan --out=phase1.plan

  12.54

  terraform apply phase1.plan

  19.12

* One approach to lower the dev cycle time

Can take a look at: 

.link https://github.com/localstack/localstack Localstack 

Supports several locally running versions of AWS Services
- API Gateway
- DynamoDB
- Kinesis
- S3
- etc.

* One approach to lower the dev cycle time

Configuring our deployment isn't exactly trivial. 

Could use terraform, but there's a current issue open to get the AWS fakes to work:

.link https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/5584 Terraform Provider Open Issue

Can have set up scripts to run before we run our tests, e.g. `make` `test` spins up, `go` `test` s, spins down.



* A better approach
